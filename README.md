# Advanced Options Pricing and Derivative Analysis  

## Overview  
This project implements and analyzes the **Binomial Options Pricing Model (BOPM)** for valuing financial derivatives. It includes theoretical foundations and practical applications, such as exotic options pricing, implied volatility computation, and algorithm optimization.

## Features  
- **Binomial Options Pricing Model (BOPM):**  
  - One-period and multi-period pricing.  
  - Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model for stock price evolution.  

- **Implied Volatility Analysis:**  
  - Root-finding techniques to compute implied volatility.  
  - Comparison with Black-Scholes model for validation.  

- **Algorithm Optimization:**  
  - Performance comparison between `binomial_pricer()` and `binomial_pricer_vectorized()`.  

- **Alternative Methods:**  
  - Equal Probabilities (EQP) and Trigeorgis (TRG) approaches for pricing accuracy.  

- **Exotic Options:**  
  - Barrier options (knock-in/knock-out).  
  - American put options with early exercise features.
